/// Unlike `*mut T`, `Unique<T>` behaves "as if" it were an instance of `T`.
/// It implements `Send`/`Sync` if `T` is `Send`/`Sync`. It also implies
/// the kind of strong aliasing guarantees an instance of `T` can expect:
/// the referent of the pointer should not be modified without a unique path to
/// its owning Unique.
///
/// If you're uncertain of whether it's correct to use `Unique` for your purposes,
/// consider using `NonNull`, which has weaker semantics.
///
/// Unlike `*mut T`, the pointer must always be non-null, even if the pointer
/// is never dereferenced. This is so that enums may use this forbidden value
/// as a discriminant -- `Option<Unique<T>>` has the same size as `Unique<T>`.
/// However the pointer may still dangle if it isn't dereferenced.
///
/// Unlike `*mut T`, `Unique<T>` is covariant over `T`. This should always be correct
/// for any type which upholds Unique's aliasing requirements.
